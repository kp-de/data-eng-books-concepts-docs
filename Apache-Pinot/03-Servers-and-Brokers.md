**Servers**  

- Servers store segments of data.

- Segments are replicated on multiple servers to minimize data loss

**Brokers**  

- Have metadata about data so that they know which server has which segments stored locally
- Know stats about data ranges etc. so that they can distribute queries efficiently to different servers
